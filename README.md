# BMI_Calculator
Built off of Professor's given code to create a simple Andriod BMI calculator.
Takes user inputted Height and Weight and calculated BMI. This project helped me practice with 
setting the background of an Android app, the app icon, setting up the main_activity.java and using the FAB.
